A terminal should pop-out. First be sure to check the version of Python. You can then continue installing any package. The terminal is case sensitive so make sure that the commands are typed accurately. After the installation is complete you can close the terminal.



Keep in mind that copy and paste mechanisms from a pdf or document sometimes do not work since there might be hidden characters. The best way to prevent installation errors from copy and paste is to type the commands.

Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks
The easiest way to find the Anaconda Application is using the Search bar located on the lower left corner of the screen. Search for Anaconda Navigator.


On the main window, find the Jupyter Notebook tab and click Launch. To start the application, a terminal should pop-up as well as a browser to start using the notebooks.


With the notebook open you can see your computer folders. Find the desktop to create a notebook working directory (folder). A working directory is where all the files related to the notebook and data will be located.


Rename the new folder accordingly (ie. to match your course name or the content of your use case).


New Jupyter Notebook
Go to the folder and create a new Python3 Notebook. Name your notebook (in this case we are using Last name, First name and homework number).


Name the new notebook.


After naming your notebook, you are ready to start working with Python3 Jupyter notebooks.
