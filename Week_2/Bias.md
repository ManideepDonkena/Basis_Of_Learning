# **Bias in machine learning**
> * Bias is a systematic error from an erroneous assumption in the machine learning algorithmâ€™s modeling. The algorithm tends to systematically learn the wrong signals by not considering all the information contained within the data.

* Bias in Machine Learning models could often lead to unexpected outcomes.



## **`Sampling bias:`**
>It is a bias in which a sample is collected in such a way that it does not represent the true distribution because of non-random reasons.
## Reducing sampling bias
>Sampling bias can be reduced by making the sample as close to the true distribution (production traffic in case of ml models) as possible.

*`Simple Random Sampling with replacement :`*

* One strategy is to use random sampling with replacement from production traffic.
* *Sampling without replacement cannot be used since the population will cease to reflect the true distribution after some draws.*

**Stratified random sampling :**

>It is a method of sampling that involves the division of a population into smaller sub-groups known as `strata`.

* Then simple random sampling with replacement is applied within each stratum.

* Members in each of these sub-groups should be distinct so that every member of all groups get equal opportunity to be selected using simple probability.

* This sampling method is also called proportional random sampling.

## **` bias:`**
>Data snooping in ML model training refers to the phenomenon where test data has been observed / used in some way while training thereby leading to low test set error but high error in production.

## Reducing Data snooping bias

* The best way to reduce chances of data snooping is to separate out train/ test / tune datasets before any pre-processing. 
* The test dataset should not be processed along with train & tune.

* Build tooling to record overlaps in train / test datasets. 
* Any overlap which arises due to non-random reasons should be investigated and removed.

* Build monitoring to detect overlaps between training and production data.
